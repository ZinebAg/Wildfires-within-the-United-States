### Possible questions

The purpose of this investigation is to give an answer to the following question:

What are the main factors that affect the propagation of wildfires within the United States?

An investigation will be conducted and consists in answering these subquestions:
- How have the number of fires in the United States of America evolved with time from 1993 to 2015?
- How do the land covers vary over time?
- How are fires distributed across the land covers and meteorological factors?

### Structure

1) Visualisation of wildfires with respect to different factors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Evolution of wildfire from 1993 to 2015 (Project 2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Distribution of wildfires with respect to meteorological factors (Zineb and Seorim)<br>
2) Wildfires and the land cover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Correlation between wildfires and the land cover, evolution of land cover (Project 2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Spread of fire based on the type of land covers (Project 2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Prediction of wildfire cases depending on the land covers (Salima)<br>
3) Wildfires and the meteorological factors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Correlation between wildfires and the meteorological factors (Project 2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Effect of wind on the spread of wildfires (Fahim)<br>
4) Subgroup analysis<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Quantile regression (Project 2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Survival analysis on the incidence of wildfires (Matias)<br>
